This is a IoT solution for a single string of RGB LEDs.

Originally for an English final, actually going to be used for a lighting solution around my house.

Run and debugged on an ESP8266-01 and Adafruit FTDI Friend

Pin connections are as follows:

  GPIO0 --> Red LED transistor
  GPIO1 --> Green LED transistor
  GPIO2 --> Blue LED transistor
  GND --> Common Ground
  Vcc --> 3.3VDC, NOT 5V
  CHIP_EN --> 3.3VDC
